# NFL Game Stats

Node utility to provide a basic API against the JSON feed the powers the NFL.com live GameCenter

Sample JSON url for [2014 Preseason game between Minnesota and Kansas City](http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/game-center/2014082305/2014082305_gtd.json)

## TODOs

* test real-time data feed during a game
* function(s) to pull JSON
* create model to store json data as for querying
* create API model for querying past data
* create API model for querying live data
